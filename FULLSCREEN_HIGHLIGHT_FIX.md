# Fullscreen Highlight Visibility Fix

## Problem Description
When users clicked the fullscreen button in the document review tab, the highlights that were visible in the normal view would disappear in fullscreen mode. This was causing confusion and making it difficult for users to see the highlighted content in the fullscreen view.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by several factors:

1. **Timing Issues**: The WordViewer component was loading document content after the fullscreen modal was opened, which could clear or override existing highlights.

2. **CSS Conflicts**: Some CSS rules were not properly targeting fullscreen highlights, causing them to be hidden or styled incorrectly.

3. **Content Recreation**: The WordViewer was recreating the document content in fullscreen mode, which would remove any previously applied highlights.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Fullscreen Highlight Loading
- Added a robust highlight loading system that waits for content to be available before applying highlights
- Implemented retry logic with multiple attempts to ensure highlights are applied
- Added automatic highlight loading after document content is ready

### 2. Improved CSS Styling
- Added comprehensive CSS rules to ensure highlights are always visible in fullscreen mode
- Used `!important` declarations to override any conflicting styles
- Added specific selectors for different highlight element types

### 3. Manual Fix Functionality
- Added a "Fix Highlights" button in the fullscreen toolbar
- Created `fixFullscreenHighlightsNow()` function that can be called manually
- Added visual feedback when highlights are fixed

### 4. Enhanced Highlight Application
- Improved the `loadHighlightsInFullscreen()` function with better error handling
- Added forced visibility styling after highlight application
- Enhanced highlight element creation with proper data attributes

## Files Modified

### 1. `systemFunda.php`
- Enhanced `openFullscreenView()` function with robust highlight loading
- Added `ensureFullscreenHighlights()` function for automatic highlight management
- Improved `loadHighlightsInFullscreen()` function with forced visibility
- Added `fixFullscreenHighlightsNow()` function for manual fixes
- Added "Fix Highlights" button to fullscreen toolbar

### 2. `assets/css/word-viewer.css`
- Added comprehensive CSS rules for fullscreen highlight visibility
- Enhanced selectors to target all possible highlight element types
- Added `!important` declarations to ensure styles are applied

### 3. `test_fullscreen_highlights.html`
- Created test page to verify the fix works correctly
- Includes mock functions for testing highlight functionality

## Key Features

### Automatic Highlight Loading
```javascript
// Enhanced highlight loading with retry logic
const ensureFullscreenHighlights = () => {
  // Wait for content to be available
  const waitForContent = (attempts = 0, maxAttempts = 10) => {
    // Check for content and apply highlights
  };
};
```

### Manual Fix Function
```javascript
// Quick fix function for immediate highlight visibility
window.fixFullscreenHighlightsNow = function() {
  // Force visibility for all highlights in fullscreen
  const highlights = fullscreenModal.querySelectorAll('.fullscreen-highlight, .highlight-marker');
  highlights.forEach(highlight => {
    highlight.style.cssText = `
      background-color: #ffeb3b !important;
      visibility: visible !important;
      opacity: 1 !important;
      // ... other styles
    `;
  });
};
```

### Enhanced CSS
```css
/* Force visibility for any highlight element in fullscreen */
.document-fullscreen-modal mark,
.document-fullscreen-modal .highlight-marker,
.document-fullscreen-modal .fullscreen-highlight {
  background-color: #ffeb3b !important;
  visibility: visible !important;
  opacity: 1 !important;
  display: inline !important;
  z-index: 1000 !important;
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers
1. To manually fix highlights: `window.fixFullscreenHighlightsNow()`
2. To reload highlights: `window.loadHighlightsInFullscreen(chapterId)`
3. To test the functionality: Open `test_fullscreen_highlights.html`

## Testing
