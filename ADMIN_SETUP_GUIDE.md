### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

**Issue 1: "Access Denied" or redirected to student dashboard**
```php
// Solution: Check user role in database
SELECT email, role FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@thesis.edu';
// Should show role as 'super_admin'
```

**Issue 2: Charts not displaying**
```javascript
// Check browser console for errors
// Ensure Chart.js is loading: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js
// Verify analytics data is being returned
```

**Issue 3: User table not loading**
```php
// Check if admin_functions.php is in the correct location
// Verify database connection in config/database.php
// Check browser network tab for AJAX errors
```

**Issue 4: Database errors**
```sql
-- Verify all tables were created
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'admin_%';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'system_%';

-- Check if admin user exists
SELECT * FROM users WHERE role IN ('admin', 'super_admin');
```
