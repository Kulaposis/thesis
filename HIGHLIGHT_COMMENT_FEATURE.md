# Highlight and Comment Feature

## Overview
The document review system now supports a two-step workflow where users can first highlight text and then add comments specifically to those highlights. **Students can now view all highlights created by their advisers** in a read-only mode.

## How to Use

#### Step 2: Comment on Highlights
1. **Click on any highlighted text** to open the comment modal
2. Enter your comment about that specific highlight
3. Click "Save Comment" to save the comment linked to that highlight

### For Students

#### Viewing Adviser Highlights
1. **Students can see all highlights** created by their advisers when viewing documents
2. **Click on any highlighted text** to view details about the highlight, including:
   - Who created the highlight (adviser name)
